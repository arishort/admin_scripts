server_name   : name of the server as you would connect to it with ssh
server_class  : p for production, d for development, t for test
server_group   : (a-e) as designated in your organization, if you don't have such a designation set them all to a
patch_group   : (0-4) defines which major patch group the server belongs to, schedules are defined in cron-update
patch_schedule: (1-4) defines which minor patch group the server belongs to, schedules are defined in cron-update

The format is standard CSV:
server_name,server_class,server_group,patch_group,patch_schedule
